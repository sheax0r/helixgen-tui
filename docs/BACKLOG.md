# helixgen-tui backlog

Numbering is local to this repo. The originating entry is helixgen-core's
backlog #29 (helixgen-tui), which carries the product mandate: cover
everything the Stadium desktop app does, slots invisible, own design spec
before any code.

- ✅ **#1 Design spec + v1 librarian** — shipped 2026-07-17:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-tui-v1-librarian-design.md` and its
  8-task implementation plan
  (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-tui-v1-librarian.md`), both fully
  built: Textual shell, tabbed Library/Setlists/IRs/Device screens,
  offline-first device handling, tiered mutation confirmation, direct Python
  API behind the `helixgen_tui.core` adapter, layered fake-core + Pilot
  testing. Released as `v0.1.0`.
- ✅ **#2 Packaging + CI skeleton** — shipped 2026-07-17 (PR #1): pyproject
  (`helixgen-tui`, `helixgen[device]>=0.26`), console script + `-m` entry,
  pytest + ruff CI, publish workflow.
- **#3 Ask core to bless a minimal stable Python API surface** for the TUI's
  needs (library/manifest/device reads, mutation verbs, locks) — the TUI
  binds the Python API directly (design D5); today only the CLI is core's
  documented contract. File the core-side entry when implementation starts
  and the real import list is known.
- **#4 Tone-designer chat screen (first post-v1 screen)** — user-requested
  2026-07-17: if Claude Code is installed locally, a fifth tab hosts a
  conversation where the user describes a tone and Claude authors it into
  the library via the helixgen plugin skills. Requirements (auth reuse,
  D4-modal permission bridging, graceful degradation, library refresh) are
  settled in the v1 design spec's "first post-v1 screen" section; binding
  choice (Agent SDK vs headless CLI) deferred to build time.
- **#5 Live smoke suite (`HELIXGEN_TUI_LIVE=1`)** — deferred per spec D6;
  validate `RealDevicePort` verbs on hardware. The v1 build's device tests
  are entirely `FakeDevicePort`-driven (no real hardware in CI or dev); this
  entry tracks writing an opt-in, env-gated suite that exercises the real
  port's per-verb delegations against an actual Helix Stadium.
- **#6 Core Python verbs missing for restore-with-cid, tone delete, single-tone
  push** — `RealDevicePort` returns `ok=False` for these; the engine change
  lands in helixgen-core first (ref #3's stable-API ask).
- **#7 Shipped-vs-spec deltas (consciously deferred in the v1 plan)** — recorded
  at v1 release so the gaps are tracked, not forgotten. Each was scoped out in
  the implementation plan, not missed:
  - **Device-side setlists pane** — the Setlists screen edits the local
    manifest only; a read-back of what's actually mirrored on the device is
    future work.
  - **Sortable tone list** — the Library table renders in library order with a
    substring filter; column sorting isn't wired.
  - **Detail-view variants + normalized telemetry** — `ToneDetailModal` shows
    name/guitar/setlists/description; per-guitar variants and normalized
    loudness/telemetry from the tone meta aren't surfaced.
  - **`--gc` from the UI** — `sync_all` always passes `gc=False`; the
    pool garbage-collect toggle is exposed on the CLI only.
  - **Tab-cycling** — modes are reached by their number keys (`1`–`4`); there's
    no `tab`/`shift+tab` cycle between them.

- **#8 Cosmetic minors from the final review (2026-07-17)** — (a) modal
  dismissal fires `ScreenResume`, rebuilding tables and resetting DataTable
  cursors to row 0 (flows unaffected; selection captured pre-modal);
  (b) device screen `r` retry needs a second press after reconnect under the
  production spawn (probe async, info refresh immediate); (c) format_device_text
  substring heuristic is fragile; (d) library filter matches name only.

## 9. v0.1.1 residuals (from PR #14 review)

- Device-pane delete/rename still resolve IRs by display name first-match on the
  device — acting on a duplicate-named *device* IR may hit the wrong entry.
  Local-pane push was fixed in v0.1.1 (pushes by irhash); the device side needs
  hash-addressed core verbs (relates #6).
- Upstream Textual bug worth reporting: on Python >= 3.12, `run_async` installs
  `asyncio.eager_task_factory`, so a MODES app whose default screen contains an
  `Input` crashes at boot (`ScreenStackError` from the selection watcher —
  `App.clear_selection` only catches `NoScreen`). We carry a `clear_selection`
  override in `app.py`; drop it once fixed upstream (textual 8.2.8 affected).
- `App.screen` can also raise `UnknownModeError` (not caught by our override);
  believed unreachable — noted in case a teardown-phase variant ever appears.
- IR selection helpers now index into the backing list and would raise
  `IndexError` on a table/list mismatch instead of degrading to None —
  intentional fail-fast, noting the behavior change.

## 10. Fuzzy search everywhere (user request, 2026-07-18)

Type part of a name to find/use the thing, wherever a list is presented:
selecting a setlist, picking a tone in the add-tone modal, the library tone
list, local/device IR panes. Today only the Library screen has a filter
(`/`), it matches name-substring only (see #8), and the pickers/panes have
none. Wants: incremental fuzzy matching (subsequence or trigram), highlight
of matches, and enter-to-act on the top hit.

## 11. Key-hints footer polish (from PR #16 review)

- At narrow widths (~80 cols) the bindings footer silently scrolls trailing
  keys out of view on binding-heavy screens (setlists) — consider compact
  key-only display or priority ordering.
- The footer also exposes Textual's command palette (^p: theme, screenshot,
  …). Decide whether that's intended product surface or should be disabled
  (`ENABLE_COMMAND_PALETTE = False`).

## 12. Console-markup bug class beyond the detail modal (from PR review, 2026-07-18)

The tiny-empty-box fix (PR: `ToneDetailModal` → `markup=False`, shipped
v0.1.3) closed one instance of a repo-wide bug: any Textual surface that
renders tone/device-derived free text with markup parsing on will strip
bracket-bearing text (`[reverb]`, `[b]…[/b]`, `[text](url)`) and **crash the
whole screen** on a malformed tag (a tone named `Bad [/] name` raises
`MarkupError`). Confirmed instances still open:
- **DataTable cells (highest severity, highest traffic).** `library.py`,
  `setlists.py`, `irs.py`, and the `AddToneModal` picker pass plain-string
  cells; Textual's `default_cell_formatter` runs `Text.from_markup` on each.
  A bracketed tone name renders corrupted in the library table *before* the
  detail modal is reachable, and a `[/]`-bearing name crashes the screen on
  load. `markup=False` does not apply to DataTable — pass `rich.text.Text`
  cell objects (a `Text` bypasses the markup parse).
- **`ConfirmModal` (`widgets/confirm_modal.py`).** `Static(body)` is
  markup-parsed and `body` includes `plan.lines` built from
  `f"{tone.name} …"`, so a bracketed tone name is stripped / a `[/]` name
  crashes the confirm dialog. Also its hardcoded `"[y] confirm  [n] cancel"`
  footer is silently stripped to `" confirm   cancel"` today — the key hints
  are invisible in the shipped product. Fix: `markup=False` + restyle/escape
  the footer.
- **`DeviceScreen` info/locks Statics (`device.py`).** `_apply_info` writes
  `f"Active tone: {state.active_tone}"` and `_apply_locks` writes free-text
  lock labels (`--label "<who>"`) into default-markup Statics — same class,
  lower traffic.

Do a single sweep converting user/device-derived text surfaces (Text cells
for tables, `markup=False` for Statics) with a regression test per surface
using a `[/]`- and `[reverb]`-bearing fixture.
